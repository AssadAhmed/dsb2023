# Data Manipulation

##   Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:

    -   Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (\> 120 minutes)
    -   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
    -   Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
    -   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    -   Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
    -   Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

```{r}
#| label: problem-1

# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (> 120 minutes)


# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)


# Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)


# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
  
  
# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late


# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
```

##   Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

<!-- -->

    flights %>% 
      filter(is.na(dep_time)) 

```{r}
#| label: problem-2

# What months had the highest and lowest % of cancelled flights?

```

##   Problem 3: What plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please `left_join()` the resulting table with the table `planes` (also included in the `nycflights13` package).

For the plane with the greatest number of flights and that had more than 50 seats, please create a table where it flew to during 2013.

```{r}


```

##   Problem 4: The `nycflights13` package includes a table (`weather`) that describes the weather during 2013. Use that table to answer the following questions:

    -   What is the distribution of temperature (`temp`) in July 2013? Identify any important outliers in terms of the `wind_speed` variable.
    -   What is the relationship between `dewp` and `humid`?
    -   What is the relationship between `precip` and `visib`?

```{r}

```

##   Problem 5: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

    -   How many planes have a missing date of manufacture?
    -   What are the five most common manufacturers?
    -   Has the distribution of manufacturer changed over time as reflected by the airplanes flying from NYC in 2013? (Hint: you may need to use case_when() to recode the manufacturer name and collapse rare vendors into a category called Other.)

```{r}

```

##   Problem 6: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

    -   What is the oldest plane (specified by the tailnum variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013?
    -   How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?

```{r}

```

##   Problem 7: Use the `nycflights13` to answer the following questions:

    -   What is the median arrival delay on a month-by-month basis in each airport?
    -   For each airline, plot the median arrival delay for each month and origin airport.

```{r}

```

##   Problem 8: Let's take a closer look at what carriers service the route to San Francisco International (SFO). Join the `flights` and `airlines` tables and count which airlines flew the most to SFO. Produce a new dataframe, `fly_into_sfo` that contains three variables: the `name` of the airline, e.g., `United Air Lines Inc.` not `UA`, the count (number) of times it flew to SFO, and the `percent` of the trips that that particular airline flew to SFO.

```{r}

```

And here is some bonus ggplot code to plot your dataframe

```{r}
#| label: ggplot-flights-toSFO
#| message: false
#| warning: false

fly_into_sfo %>% 
  
  # sort 'name' of airline by the numbers it times to flew to SFO
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, count)) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  aes(x = count, 
      y = name) +
  
  # a simple bar/column plot
  geom_col() +
  
  # add labels, so each bar shows the % of total flights 
  geom_text(aes(label = percent),
             hjust = 1, 
             colour = "white", 
             size = 5)+
  
  # add labels to help our audience  
  labs(title="Which airline dominates the NYC to SFO route?", 
       subtitle = "as % of total flights in 2013",
       x= "Number of flights",
       y= NULL) +
  
  theme_minimal() + 
  
  # change the theme-- i just googled those , but you can use the ggThemeAssist add-in
  # https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggThemeAssist/index.html
  
  theme(#
    # so title is left-aligned
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    
    # text in axes appears larger        
    axis.text = element_text(size=12),
    
    # title text is bigger
    plot.title = element_text(size=18)
      ) +

  # add one final layer of NULL, so if you comment out any lines
  # you never end up with a hanging `+` that awaits another ggplot layer
  NULL
 
 
```

##   Problem 9: Let's take a look at cancellations of flights to SFO. We create a new dataframe `cancellations` as follows

```{r}

cancellations <- flights %>% 
  
  # just filter for destination == 'SFO'
  filter(dest == 'SFO') %>% 
  
  # a cancelled flight is one with no `dep_time` 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))

```

I want you to think how we would organise our data manipulation to create the following plot. No need to write the code, just explain in words how you would go about it.

# Deliverables

There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed Quarto Markdown (qmd) file as an HTML document (use the "Render" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.
